### My trip to Ecuador

In December 2015 I went to Ecuador and explored all I could.  Starting off landing in Quito and staying there for a few hours my friend and I then took off to the Galapagos Islands.

##### Day 1
Today we landed, got our hostel in Puerto Ayora and decided to check out Tortuga Bay.  Not 24hrs into the trip and we had already seen Galapagos iguanas, reef sharks, blue footed boobies, and sea turtles.

Quite a nice day to hang out at the beach and relax after many flights to get there.

Quilotoa is an amazing crater lake at about 13000ft above sealevel that you can hike all the way around.
