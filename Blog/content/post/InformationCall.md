What if we could live in a world where current events were reported fairly and unbiased?  Last year I read a book Infomocracy, which was about the world in the near future that had adopted micro-democracy where small territories would decide which controlling power they wanted.   In this world, the entire planet got all news and data about current events from a neutral organization that aggregated all of the world's information and verified its validity.  Information seemed like an interesting concept to me at the time but somewhat farfetched.

The further I got into the American election cycle I felt that the world in the book was plausible.  Every day there was a new news story breaking about how candidate X did thing Y, however, depending what news agency you got your news from the same story could be reported wildly different.  Post election the Democrat party started blaming their loss on everything they could think of racists, white people, the FBI, Russia, voter fraud, the Electoral College, and finally fake news.  

As corporations like Google and Facebook begin to attack "fake news," I question their definition of truth. While I don't usually care about an organization's political views, I become alarmed when they start censoring things they deem as "fake" out of the view of the public.  An organization like Information from Infomocracy could be the solution.

Information works like this; an event occurs somewhere if they have a source on the scene that person or persons will report the event to Information.  The organization then confirms what they can and publish it to the network which is globally connected.  If a whistleblower want's to come forward, they have handlers to collect the data and publish what they can.  Throughout this entire process, the opinions and viewpoints of the sources and authors are left out leaving it up to the individual reader to decide what their views on the matters are.

I could see this working in our current news market.  Currently, I have to view multiple sources on a given story or see the raw data to come to a conclusion of what the truth is.  The single biggest drawback of an organization like Information is it leaves a single point of failure, for example, if you can corrupt that only source then you can control the opinions of the people.  If access is blocked to the source, then events can be hidden.

In conclusion, I think the media has ended up in a disaster of their making, and they are in a death spiral with each other as they shape the events to be what they want them to be, sometimes even blatantly lying.  If there is a transparent process involved in determining the validity of a given article, I feel the public can hold institutions that wish to censor, accountable.  The best solution I can see right now though would be an organization that can build a reputation of reporting facts unbiased and as truthfully as possible.

Thanks for reading!
