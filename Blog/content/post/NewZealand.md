## Short TL;DR with picture 
New Zealand is a phenominal place with diverse landscape, friendly people, and more to see than one trip can cover.

### Wellington
I flew into Auckland from Vancouver wich was a direct flight (if you live in the Seattle area look at flying out of Vancouver for the direct flights).  Stayed a night in Auckland but moved on pretty quickly down to Wellington while making a quick stop in Rotoura to go ZORBing.  ZORBing is where you get in a giant inflated ball that is hollow on the inside and the get pushed off a hill, quite fun!  From there I drove to Wellington which turned out to be a much longer drive than I had anticipated (thanks mercador projection).  Wellington is a really easy place to get around by foot.  I spent some time to see the Te Papa museum which is a wonderful museum which also happens to be free.  I also rode the cable car up the hill to the botannical gardens and observatory.

### West coast of the south island
Wellington was great but it was time to see the south island which came highly recommended by everyone I talked to.  Hopped on the ferry and three and a half hours later I was on the south island.  I tried to go to Mt. Stokes since I heard the views were really beautiful but ran into the most curvy road on my way up wich ate up a lot of time. Hung out in Nelson for a night and then the real adventure began.

On my way to Westport I went to Cape Foulwind wich looked like something out of a fantasy movie.  I made a short detour here to see the seal colony near by which was cool.  I continued down the goregous coast line to the Te Nikau hostel which is in the rainforest, like literally in the rainforest, I would highly recommended it.  After checking in I decided to see the pancake rocks and attempt the Pororari river track.  The pancake rocks were really cool but I'm sure they would be even better at high tide.  Tried some Kawa Kawa tea that a guest at the hostel made from a plant in the parking lot, which was delicious.  Made it back on the road and did a bit of the Pororari river track but eventually had to turn back if I wanted to continue south without having to drive at night.

Visited Hokitika which has cool coffee/craft shop that made a really good long black (Americano).  The Hokitika Gorge is also rather stunning due to the vibrant blue color the water has from a mineral in the rocks.  After checking out the beautiful sights I made it down to Frans Josef to attemt to climb on a glacier.  The helicopter ended up being grounded due to rain and I didn't have enough time to stay another night to attempt it again so I continued on.  While I didn't get to go on the glacier I took a hike to see the base of it which was well worth it.  Continuing on to Hasst pass a friend I had picked up pointed out to me a beach where people write memories on white rocks, while we didn't go because the pass might have been closed I want to go there on my next trip.  Hasst pass was safe enough to drive and turned out to be stunningly beautiful with all the snow on the green foliage as well as seeing Thundercreek falls.  Stayed in Wanaka for the night.

### Area around Queenstown
My friend had told me about a hike near Wanaka called Roy's Peak, boy was it worth it!  Roy's Peak is a bit of a steep hike but the views near the top are stunning, you can see the Alps all around as well as the two big lakes below.  This had to be one of my favorite destinations all trip.  Moving onto Queenstown I took the Queens Range road which was worthy of a Japanese drift track (hear that The Grand Tour).

In Queenstown I did a cool hike to a place called Sam's Hut, a fun little hike with a friend I made in Vancouver a while back and a new friend that happend to be from my home state.  I also learned that old structures are very different in New Zealand than they are in America.  In America there would be a large fence around the place telling people look but not touch, however in New Zealand you can go in and see the place.  Overall Queenstown was very beautiful and I really want to go snowboarding there some day.

### New Plymouth and going home

## Tips
  - Stay as long as you can, you could easily spend a year on just one of the islands.
  - Make sure you can rent your car on the north island but leave it on the south island, this way you can spend more time in the south and then fly back to the north island when you need to leave.
  - Bring warm clothes if you're visiting in the winter/spring time.
  - Hike Roy's Peak
  - Bring a couple hundred extra dollars for spontanous things like a helicopter to the Frans Josef glacier or viewing the stars at Lake Tekapo.
  - Climb Mt. Doom and pretend you're a hobbit.
