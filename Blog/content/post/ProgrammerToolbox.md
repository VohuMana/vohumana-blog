Over the years many programmers have tried to apply a single language as the "magic bullet", the one language to rule them all.  While this is a noble effort it is fruitless because there will never be a single language that can do everything.  The biggest issue I have noticed recently is the application of JavaScript to everything, Node JS for servers, Electron for standalone apps, etc.  While this is great for rapid prototyping the underlying infrastructure would have to change to be scalable.  Now don't think I am just picking on JavaScript since people started programming they have always been trying to do more with less.  No one writes individual operation codes these days, at most they write assembly, and that is a good thing.

In this day and age, we aren't limited to a few different languages, there are thousands.  A great many languages are variations on existing more popular languages but each language has its area that it has tried to solve something missing.  For example, JavaScript filled the need to run code on the client in a web environment.  A long time ago learning a new language was a lot more difficult, you had to wait for a book or look at the syntax and figure things out.  Nowadays you can just load up Pluralsight, CodeSchool, a language sandbox, random blog, etc. to learn in a hurry.  Since learning can happen so fast I feel it is much more efficient and scalable to learn a new language that applies to the problem you are working on than trying to adapt a language built to solve another problem.

As a broad overview here is what I think these languages are best at:

  - C - Best for embedded systems, systems development, or anything requiring full control over the machine you are programming on.
  - C++ - Best for games, financial trading, compilers, systems development, or anything requiring programs to be CPU and memory efficient.
  - Python - Best for data science, math, science, machine learning, or scripting.
  - JavaScript - The absolute best for client side web work or rapid prototyping.
  - C# - Best for enterprise applications, programs on Windows, web servers.
  - Erlang - Best for extremely scalable web servers or highly concurrent programs.
  - Ruby - Best for web servers.
  - R - Best for data science.
  - Java - Best for Android development or embedded systems.
  - Go - Best for native-like performance without managing memory. Think modern C.
  - Rust - Best for native level performance without dealing with memory leaks.  Think modern C++

I hope this guides you to learn a new language and add a tool to your toolbox.  You never know when one of these might come in handy.
