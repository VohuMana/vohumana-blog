### About
Currently a Software Engineer working at Microsoft I helped create Quick Assist in Windows 10 and drive a better support expirence for customers and agents.  I studied Real-Time Interactive simulation at DigiPen which is a long way of saying I learned how computers work at their most basic components and developed video games.

  * [Luminosity](http://games.digipen.edu/games/luminosity#.VvDqw0d7ebI)

### Why is your blog called "The Well of Insatiable Curiosity"?
I find my self constatnly curious and always wanting to learn why things work the way the do.  The title I feel conveys my drive to learn.

### What are your interests?
  * Learning new languages (programming/spoken)
  * Mythology
  * Travel/Exploration
  * Computer graphics
  * So many more...

### Will you teach me to code?
> **"** Code to learn.  Don't learn to code. **"** - Unknown

Short answer: No
Long answer: I'm willing to help but won't teach you.  If you want to start learning I would recommend starting with Python, if you like that then you can decide what projects you want to do.

**Thanks for reading!**
